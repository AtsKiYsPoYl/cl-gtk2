"This package contains bindings to GLib object system called GObject.

It contains:
@begin{itemize}
@item{type system}
@item{object system}
@item{utilities for memory management}
@end{itemize}

@begin[GObject type system querying]{section}
GObject type information can queried. Type is identified by GType â€” an integer.

Function @fun{g-type-from-name} returns GType by its name, and function @fun{g-type-name} returns the name of a GType. Function @fun{ensure-g-type} is a convenience function that returns GType from either GType or its name.

Functions @fun{g-type-parent} and @fun{g-type-children} inspect type hierarchy.
@end{section}

@begin[GValue]{section}
GValue is a GObject's \"variant\"-like type. It can contain value of any type that GObject supports. The GValue is used for passing parameters to signal handlers, properties' getters and setters. Functions @fun{g-value-init}, @fun{g-value-unset}, @fun{g-value-zero}, @fun{parse-gvalue} and @fun{set-g-value} are used to init, reset, retrieve and assign GValue structures.
@end{section}

@begin[Utilities]{section}
GObject contains implementation of stable pointers. Stable pointer is a reference that can be passed between FFI boundaries. Stable pointer is an integer that is allocated with @fun{allocate-stable-pointer}. This integer can be passed to other code and back. The value of this pointer (that is retrieved with @fun{get-stable-pointer-value}) is stable, staying the same until the pointer is freed with @fun{free-stable-pointer}. For convenience, @fun{with-stable-pointer} macro is provided.
